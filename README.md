# Fluoride (Colgate Toothpaste Scraper)
*Colgate Toothpaste Web Scraping Project*
A mini project built for learning purposes - and out of curiosity.

One day my date left his toothpaste in the bathroom. The word "fluoride" caught me yey in big letters. 
I googled it, got curious, and decided to check what Colgate offers in terms of Fluoride-based products.

This scraper:
* Collects all available Colgate toothpastes from the official website
* Extracts product name, rating (stars), number of reviews, and active ingredients
* Marks which products contain fluoride
* Saves the final data to an Excel file

What I learned:
This project helped me dive deep into:
- Web scraping with Selenium
- Dealing with pop-ups, slow-loading elements, and tricky selectors
- Regular expressions (regex)
- How to structure and document a full working pipeline

    This project is for educational use only.

    I have no affiliation with Colgate and no intention of misusing the data.

  By the way... I'm still skeptical about fluoride ;) 

How to run:
1) Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
2) Run the script
   python colgate_final.py
